    <p> Weâ€™re stoked you want to try Foundation! To get going, this file (index.html) includes some basic styles you can modify, play around with, or totally destroy to get going.
        Once you've exhausted the fun in this document, you should check out: Foundation Documentation Everything you need to know about using the framework. Foundation on Github Latest code, issue reports, feature requests and more.
        @foundation zurb Ping us on Twitter if you have questions. If you build something with this we'd love to see it (and send you a totally boss sticker).
